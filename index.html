                <p>Hi! My name is Porscha and art is my life. Whether it be videography, photography, illlustraion or
                    graphic design, I'm super excited to start working as a junior creative in the industry. Although I
                    am only a student at the moment, I've already had many opportunities to work amoungst others,
                    including doing videography and graphic design for the Secret Sneaker Store in Melbourne, and
                    working under the communications manager at a festival as part of a mentorship.</p>
